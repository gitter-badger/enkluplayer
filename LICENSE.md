### CreateAR’s Terms of Service for Students and Educational Uses

Welcome to CreateAR’s software platform to create, operate, and experience mixed reality worlds.  We offer you the opportunity to explore our platform and to join the community that contributes to its further growth.

This Terms of Service (also called “Agreement” or “TOS”) is a legal agreement between CreateAR Corp.(“CreateAR”) and you regarding your use of CreateAR's applications, including the Enklu Player and associated documentation (the "Platform").  Your use of the Platform constitutes acceptance of the terms of this Agreement.

##### The License

CreateAR hereby grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive license of the Platform solely as part of your academic work to create projects and your own “creations” only for non-commercial purposes and only for the Term (defined below) at all times subject to the limitations in this TOS.  CreateAR hereby grants you a license to download the Enklu Player, which involves making only one copy on your computer.  Your use of the Enklu Player is subject to the grant of rights and the restrictions set forth in this Agreement.

##### The Restrictions

When using the Platform, you must use it in a manner that complies with the applicable laws in the jurisdiction(s) in which you use the Platform.  You are not permitted to sell, resell, rent, lease or exchange the Platform, any portion(s) thereof and/or results of your use of the Platform.  You shall not remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on the Platform.  You are not permitted to make any copies or derivative works of any portion(s) of the Platform, but you are permitted to make changes so long as you contribute them to CreateAR through uploading where specified to Github.

Please remember that this software is licensed, not sold. 

##### Open-Source Notices

Certain components of the Platform may be subject to open-source software licenses ("Open-Source Components"), which means any software license approved as open-source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including without limitation any license that, as a condition of distribution of the software licensed under such license, requires that the distributor make the software available in source code format. The Platform documentation includes copies of the licenses applicable to the Open-Source Components.

To the extent there is conflict between the license terms covering the Open-Source Components and this Agreement, the terms of such licenses will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open-Source Components prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open-Source Component, such restrictions will not apply to such Open-Source Component. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open-Source Components require Licensor to make an offer to provide source code in connection with the Product, such offer is hereby made, and you may exercise it by contacting support@createar.co.

##### Intellectual Property Notices

The Platform and all worldwide copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights therein are the exclusive property of CreateAR.  CreateAR reserves all rights in and to the Platform not expressly granted to you in this Agreement.

The names Enklu, Enklu Web, Enklu Player, Enklu HoloLens, Trellis, and related Enklu logos and/or stylized names are trademarks of CreateAR. You agree not to display or use these trademarks in any manner without CreateAR's prior written permission.

##### Your Access

CreateAR reserves the right at any time and from time to time to suspend or terminate your access to the Platform for any or no reason.

##### Changes to this Agreement by CreateAR

CreateAR reserves the right at any time and from time to time to revise, amend or otherwise modify this Agreement.

##### General Provisions

The failure of CreateAR to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and CreateAR and governs your use of the Platform, superseding any prior agreements between you and CreateAR (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Agreement).  Except as set forth in this Agreement under the section “Changes to this Agreement by AR,” this Agreement cannot be amended, modified or otherwise altered in any manner, whether oral or written (such as an exchange of emails), but only by a written agreement signed by an authorized officer of CreateAR and by you that expressly states that the parties agree and acknowledge that this Agreement is being thusly altered.  An exchange of emails does not constitute such a written agreement.

You agree that this Agreement and your use of the Platform are governed by California law, without giving effect to conflict of laws principles, statutes and case law.  CreateAR and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts sitting in the County of San Francisco, the City of Sab Francisco.
