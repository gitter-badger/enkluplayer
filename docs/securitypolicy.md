### Security Policy

We take security very seriously. We also know that mistakes happen, and vulnerabilities will make their way into every software project. This document describes a clear policy for reporting vulnerabilities and how to patch them.

##### Reporting a Vulnerability

Until we are able to setup a bounty program, all security bugs should be emailed directly to security@enklu.com. Please include the information typically provided in a bug report. Your email will be responded to within 48 hours.

Once a security issue has been verified by our core team, a fix will be made for the current master branch. Additional releases may be patched if there is need.
