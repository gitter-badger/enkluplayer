# Overview

**Enklu Player** is an Augmented Reality (AR) runtime for UWP, WebGL, Android, and iOS.

* **Highly Iterative**: Enklu Player gives users instant feedback. Change layout, assets, UI, or scripts on the fly. There's no need to rebuild-- Enklu Player will automatically download the newest data.
* **Truly Cross Platform**: Different platforms have different needs, and Enklu Player doesn't just compile to multiple targets, it allows users to tailor AR experiences to multiple platforms.
* **Out of the Box Networking**: Enklu Player provides networking support with our cloud services or your own. Multiple users can edit an application together in realtime on separate devices, while many users simultaneously play through an experience. Collaboration and social engagement are pillars of Enklu Player.

### Getting Up and Running

To develop with Enklu Player, you will need a few prerequisites.

* Requires **Unity 2018.1.1**.
* Setup your [ApplicationConfig.json](docs/applicationconfig.md) file. A default has been provided.
* Enklu Player does not require an Enklu account, but it is best used with an [Enklu Web](https://editor.enklu.com) account. An account is required to use Enklu Player's builtin multi-user editing, realtime multiplayer features, asset import system, or conductor application.

See the [building](docs/building.md) documentation for device builds.
