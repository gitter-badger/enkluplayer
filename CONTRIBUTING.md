### Contributing to Enklu Player

Thanks for joining our effort!

##### Did you find a bug?

* **Do NOT open a GitHub issue if you have found a security vulnerability in Enklu Player.** Instead, please refer to our [security policy](docs/securitypolicy.md).
* **Ensure your issue is not a duplicate** by searching the existing GitHub issues.
* If you are sure your issue is unique, [open a new issue](http://github.com/enklu/enkluplayer/issues/new). Please include
  * **A clear title and description**.
  * As much relevant information as you can stomach. Version, use case, reproduction steps, etc.
  * **Your expected result**. This is important to know from the get go, as sometimes our expectations may be mismatched.
  * A **code sample** or **test case** that shows the behavior.
  * Once you have submitted your issue, it's not quite time to sit back and relax. Instead, **this is the time to collaborate** with us and with others in the community on how we might solve it together. Creating an issue is the first step in helping *you* solve it by talking openly about it.

##### Are you resolving a bug?

* Open a new PR with your patch.
* Please provide a link to the issue, if one exists. If not, provide justification and a test case for your fix.
* Clearly describe the problem and solution.
* Make sure to follow our [style guide](docs/styleguide.md).

##### Are you proposing a new feature?

* **Please do not create "wishlist" issues in GitHub**. A new feature request with no accompanying code will be closed. If you wish to propose a new feature, the onus is on you to create that feature or to team up with some one that can.
* We love feature submissions, but we don't have the bandwidth to crank them all out ourselves!
* Work in a branch labeled **feature/[short name]**.
* If you would like feedback on your feature branch, feel free to open a pull request at that point.

##### Are you making a purely cosmetic change?

* These PRs are generally fixing style or formatting issues. These types of PRs will **generally not be accepted**. Shortly put: with limited resources on the core team, the extra effort of having to review and test is not worth the small changes.
